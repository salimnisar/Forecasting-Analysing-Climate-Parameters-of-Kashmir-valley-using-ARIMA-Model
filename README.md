# Forecasting-Analysing-Climate-Parameters-of-Kashmir-valley-using-ARIMA-Model
The aim of the project is to visualize and analyze the climate scenario in Kashmir valley using variables such as precipitation, temperature and cloud cover, as well as to forecast the same for the future. Using timeseries based machine learning models to predict future climate trends and effects on climate variables such as temperature, cloud cover and precipitation. With over a century's worth of data available to train our model, forecasts will be done for the next 80 years.
